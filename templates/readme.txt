This folder contains the templates used in the ISTART-ugdg analyses.

Model 18 corresponds to a model that makes bins for dg and ug proposer decisions. This is used for plotting purposes only!
Model 19 correspondes to the models used in analyses. Use this for act and ppi.

Use L3_Composite and L3_Composite_noInt for the L3 analyses. Composite reflects substance use and reward sensitivity with combined measures for AUDIT/DUDIT and BAS/SPSRQ respectively due to high collinearity with these respective measures.

Composite contains interactions for substance use and reward sensitivity. After running the L3 models, analyze noInt first for interactions. If no interactions exist, then move on to the output of L3_COMPOSITE (which looks at main effects only).
